# Wallpaper Maker

The **Wallpaper Maker** app is an interactive web application built with JavaScript on Code.org. This project allows users to create customized wallpapers by placing random icons, adjusting colors, and changing backgrounds. It combines creativity with technical skills to deliver a fun and dynamic experience for users.

Even though [**Star Wars Datapad**](https://github.com/TheAbubakrAbu/Star-Wars-Datapad) was my first project in **AP Computer Science Principles** during my **sophomore (10th grade) year in Fall 2021**, it was just a demo under 200 lines of code and only translated "Hello There!" in Aurebesh. Wallpaper Maker, however, was the **first real programming project I ever made**, starting at 2000 lines of code. I spent countless hours on this project, and as I learned better tools and coding techniques, I revisited it multiple times, refining it down to **a little under 1000 lines** for greater efficiency. This was my **first big coding project**, and it taught me so much about programming and optimization.

## About the Project

The Wallpaper Maker app enables users to unleash their creativity by designing wallpapers with customizable features. Itâ€™s not just a tool for wallpaper creation but also an excellent way to learn about programming interactivity and design principles.

### Key Features:

1. **Customizable Icons:**
   - Choose from a variety of shapes, including hearts, stars, lightning bolts, and more.
   - Randomize icon types and sizes for a unique look every time.

2. **Color Options:**
   - Customize icon colors with options like red, blue, green, yellow, purple, and more.
   - Add randomness to colors for creative and unpredictable results.

3. **Background Customization:**
   - Select from multiple background colors and pre-designed Star Wars-inspired wallpapers.
   - Randomize background choices for a dynamic experience.

4. **Dynamic Interaction:**
   - Place icons in random locations on the wallpaper.
   - Toggle and hide UI elements for a clean and focused design experience.

5. **Optimized Code:**
   - Originally 2000 lines, reduced to under 1000 through efficient refactoring.
